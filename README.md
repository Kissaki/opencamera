# Open Camera Source Mirror

Open Camera is an Open Source Camera app for Androidâ„¢ phones and tablets.

* [Open Camera Website](https://opencamera.org.uk/)
* [Open Camera in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera)
* [Open Camera SourceForce project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencamera/)

## Why Mirror the Sources?

I find the SourceForge web interface not very approachable.
